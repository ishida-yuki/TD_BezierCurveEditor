This tox allows CHOP curve creation and editing in a simple interface.


# Usage
1. Put BezierCurveEditor.tox to somewhere
2. `Ctrl + Shift + F` to open ShaderBuilder palette
3. Create an operator with drag & drop on the network editor

# Parameters
`Auto Update`: When on curves are automatically updated when edited on the interface (can also be toggled on/off from the Lock Icon in the lower right corner of the created Container COMP).

`Update`: Updates the values of the curve to those on the interface (enabled only when Auto Update is off).

`Length`: Set the number of samples for the curve (first value: prepend, third value: append)

`To Range`: Specify the low and high range of the curve.
